**Impact Factor now 3.002** 

Operations research and computers meet in a large number of scientific fields, many of which are of vital current concern to our troubled society. These include, among others, ecology, transportation, safety, reliability, urban planning, economics, inventory control, investment strategy and military analysis. This journal provides an international forum for the application of computers and operations research techniques to problems in these and related fields.

**Impact Factor now 4.873** 

*Applied Soft Computing* is an international journal promoting an integrated view of **soft computing** to solve real life problems. Soft computing is a collection of  methodologies, which aim to exploit tolerance for imprecision,  uncertainty and partial truth to achieve tractability, robustness and  low solution cost. The focus is to publish the highest quality research  in application and convergence of the areas of **Fuzzy Logic**, **Neural Networks**, **Evolutionary Computing**, **Rough Sets** and other similar techniques to address real world complexities.

*Applied Soft Computing* is a rolling publication: articles are published as soon as the [editor-in-chief](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/applied-soft-computing/editorial-board/) has accepted them. Therefore, the web site will continuously be updated with new articles and the publication time will be short.

###  [Engineering Optimization](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&journalCode=geno20)   

**Impact Factor now 1.728** 

**Engineering Optimization**  is an interdisciplinary  engineering journal which serves the large technical community concerned with quantitative computational methods of optimization, and their  application to engineering planning, design, manufacture and operational processes. The policy of the journal treats optimization as any  formalized numerical process for improvement. Algorithms for numerical  optimization are therefore mainstream for the journal, but equally  welcome are papers which use the methods of operations research,  decision support, statistical decision theory, systems theory, logical  inference, knowledge-based systems, artificial intelligence, information theory and processing, and all methods which can be used in the  quantitative modelling of the decision-making process.

Innovation in optimization is an essential attribute of all papers but engineering applicability is equally vital.  **Engineering Optimization**  aims to cover all disciplines within the engineering community though  its main focus is in the areas of environmental, civil, mechanical,  aerospace and manufacturing engineering. Papers on both research aspects and practical industrial implementations are welcomed.
